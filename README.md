# Autoencoders Wild Cat Image Classification unsupervised and Image retrieval

I have created an Autoencoder model to classify the images of the Wild Cats. An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient data codings in an unsupervised manner. Here I have created a basic model of autoencoder without adding up any noise to classify the images using Convolutional layers.

Using NearestNeighbor algorithm I have successfully retrieved similar images based on the eucledian distances of various wild cats as shown below:

## PART I: Using Raw Images

## 1) Lion:

## 2) Wolf:

## 3) Cheetah:

## 4) White Tiger/Tiger:

Here there is a limitation of this model which is, the model does not classify between cheetahs and leopards properly as they both have spots and the difference is just of their body size. 

## PART II: Using Edge detected Images:

## 1) Lion:
